### Introduction
Our method to tackle the Red Ocelot project was to use GitHub API integration to dynamically load the charts. There are 4 charts the bubble chart, bar chart, histogram and the pie chart. Each one this chart will display different information. Also, there are different repositories from which you can change them, and it will dynamically load the data from that specific repository. 

### Key Features 
1. The first feature is to display the data in a graph which is accessed by a button when pressed. This is be done on the same page, when the button is pressed the text-container will disappear and a graph will replace it.
2. The graphs have the option to zoom in and see the data more accurately.
3. There is a dropdown which will allow you to select the repository you want, and it will change the data live.
4. Can input the users name and be able to select the graph they want from the repo they want, this will allows them to be able to compare the results from different users. This allows the users to see theirs and others productivity.


### Connection to the Backend
The frontend connects to the backend using the GitHub API integration. This allows it to load the graphs in dynamically, which will allow a smoother interaction with the interface.
